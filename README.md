<h3>Notable Projects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/zeeebs/TTA-C-PlusPlus-And-UnrealEngine-Projects/tree/main/MyProject"_blank">First-Person Shooter Game</a></li>
    <p>This is a simple Unreal Engine game that uses a first-person character with the goal of destroying all the blocks in the environment. Blueprints were used to provide a counter and counter HUD, as well as a win screen when the goal is achieved. Upon collision between the projectile and the box, the box is destroyed, and the counter changes.

    <li><a href="https://github.com/zeeebs/TTA-C-PlusPlus-And-UnrealEngine-Projects/tree/main/UnrealLearningKit"_blank">Unreal Learning Kit - Hour Of Code</a></li>
    <p>Using the Unreal Learning Kit Hour of Code map, I added to the existing levels using blueprints for collectible items as well as specialty items and sound effects. Animation was also utilized for moving platforms to create an obstacle for the user.
